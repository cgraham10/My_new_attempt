            The Problem:<BR>
                We discovered that government websites, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency,  can overwhelm people due to unclear navigation and the large amount of information housed on the webpage.<BR><br>
            The Solution:<BR>
                We believe that there is an opportunity to provide users with an easier navigation system and clean up the amount of information housed on the homepage.<BR><BR>
            
                Tools:<BR>
                    Miro, Google Workplace, Figma, Slack, Zoom<BR><BR>
                My Responsibilities:<BR>
                    UX Research, Ideation, Prototyping, User Testing, Iterations.

            1. Menu:<BR>
                The menu bar on this site is directed towards the entire Canadian government but it is not relevant to the CFIA Website. Currently there is no Navigation bar for the CFIA. Since this is global navigation, we should move it to the top of the web page. A new Navigation bar needs to be created to help the user work through the CFIA website specifically.<br><BR>
                2. CFIA-Sepcific Information:<BR>
                These sections should be converted into a navigation/menu bar for the CFIA. The can be sorted based on similarities.  Using card sorting we will break down L1/L2 content within the new navigation bar to better sort the content.<BR><Br>
                3. Most Requested:<br>
                This can be removed or possibly moved to pop up as suggested search options when the user clicks the “Search” bar.
